# Back to the Future Clock
This is a case for the BTTF clocked built at shackspace.

## Front
- bttf_front_frame.plt
- bttf_front_frame.rld

This file contains the front frame, use a nice material for this ;)

### Front spacers
- bttf_front_pcb_spacers.plt
- bttf_front_pcb_spacers.rld

These are spacers that fit in between the front panel of the clock and the PCBs. Use 3mm material and layer two each above each other or use 6mm material and plot only have the pieces.
Place spacers so that they're wedged between the front panel and PCBs when screwing the PCBs tight.

## Sides and Back
- bttf_box_sides_and_back.plt
- bttf_box_sides_and_back.rld

These are the sides and back part complete with holes to mount an Arduino on the bottom, means to hang the clock on a wall, and little holes to route an optional USB cable to the outside world either on the side (when clock is placed on a desk) or bottom (clock hanging on wall).
